 The Library is licensed under the GNU Lesser GPL (LGPL), so you can 
 also write close-sourced thing which links to the library (if you 
 really have to ...).
+gpl.txt for the GPL and client/lgpl.txt for the LGPL are included too.
 if I'm mistaken in any ownership-concerns, please tell me and don't be 
 too mad at me, as I have had no idea of licensing at all.
