Log:
Updated (L)GPL license files

GPL delivered with s3d used the old term &quot;GNU Library General Public License&quot; instead of &quot;GNU Lesser General Public License&quot; used in the source files. Files were taken from FSF and no license restrictions of s3d and/or it's components were changed.
